    <h1 class=about><i>a bit about me:</i></h1>
    <p>
    Ever since <i>Iron Man</i> came out in 2008, I have become obsessed
    with discovering how various technologies work and creating my own. 
    This lead me to achieve a Bachelor's in computer science at 
    Appalachian State University and am currently pushing for my 
    Master's at the same university.

    Outside of class, I love to
    tinker. At the age of 12, I found a love 
    for hobby-level remote controlled cars. They are built for
    speed, so naturally they experience a lot of wrecks, but
    fixing them and tuning them up is half the fun! <a href=
    "pages/car.html">Here</a> is a bumpy video of me driving
    the car on the campus of Appalachian State.
    I am also a novice at crotcheting.  It gives me something
    to do with my hands besides hacking away at a keyboard, 
    and it's an extremely relaxing hobby.

    <h1>about the site:</h1>
    <p>
      This site was made as a personal project to tinker with
      a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">
      Raspberry Pi</a>(right). The Pi is a small inexpensive 
      computer on a chip that's perfect for a web server (and
      many other applications).

      A big thanks to Pablo Puigcerber's 
      <a href="https://www.toptal.com/raspberry-pi/how-to-turn-your-raspberry-pi-into-a-development-server" target="_blank">
      step-by-step tutorial</a>
      on how to set up the Pi for a webserver. 
      The domain name was procured with <a href= "https://www.namecheap.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4Nri_dzm4AIVhYrICh3zVwA6EAAYASAAEgLX7fD_BwE" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>, an informative 
      and easy-to-use site to purchase any domain for cheap.
      The bulb icon on the tab was made by

      I took in undergrad.
