	<h2>robot guide dog (in progress)</h2>
	<p> The goal of my Master's project is to design a 
	    robotic guide for the blind and visually impaired. To
	    do this, the robot is equipped with a Light Detection
	    and Ranging (LiDAR) device to detect objects around 
	    it.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The plan is to add a handle to the robot, and have 
	    the robot guide the user and avoid obstacles. If 
	    faced with an intersection, the robot should stop 
	    and ask the user which way they would like to go.

	<h2>kepler orbital simulator</h2>
	<p> This simulator was made as my senior capstone
	    project for the Appalachian State Astronomy Labs.
	    This program has the ability to display planetary
	    positions given any date using Kepler's laws of 
	    planetary motion.
	</p>
        <p>	
	    The simulator that the lab students were using before
	    was made before I was born. It was slow, glitchy,
	    and difficult to use. A collegue and I decided to
	    update it to the 21st century. <a href="kepler.html">
            Here</a> is a video of the simulator in action.

	<h2>orbis</h2>
        <p> Orbis was made by my roommate and I in our freshman
	    year as a personal project to put our newly found
	    programming skills to the test. <a href="orbis.html">
            Here</a> is a link to some gameplay.  This simple 
            game is a top-down shooter where the player is a 
	    circle (orb) fighting against endless waves of 
	    enemy circles.
	</p>
	<p> We didn't quite understand github back then, and so
	    google drive seemed to be the most sensible option
	    at the time. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9nEyCYyGtJnellnU1ExWkpZbDQ" target="_blank">
	    Here</a> is a drive link for the game download 
            (works on Windows and Mac).
