      <h1 class=hello><i>Hello,</i></h1>
      <h1 class=about><i>a bit about me...</i></h1>
      <p>
        I am a graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering
        Physics at Appalachian State University.  I am anticipating graduation 
	in <strong>May 2021</strong>.  I have always enjoyed tinkering since
        I was little with a small dream of building the <i>Iron Man</i> suit. This 
        dream grew into a passion for building robots and developing the software that
        gives them life.

      <h2>Appalachian State University</h2>

      <h3>Instructional Assistant <span class=date>Sept. 2018  -  Present</span></h3>
      <p>
        I lead weekly labs for students in introductory Java and Python
        programming classes.  This involves supervising, answering questions,
        and reinforcing computer science material to students.
        I also hold office hours for students throughout the week and
        occasionally lead lecture-based classes.   
      </p>

      <h3>Robotics Research <span class=date>Sept. 2017  -  Present</span></h3>
      <p>
        This position involves building robots and developing software for
        autonomous motion, wireless communication, 
        and data collection. A detailed overview of what I am working on
        is below.  
      </p>

      <h3>General Research <span class=date>Feb. 2017  -  May 2017</span></h3>
      <p>
        Gathered data on college graduation rates based on a variety of factors
        such as parental income, race, study habits, and others to determine 
        how each of these played a role in graduation rates.  
      </p>

      <h3>Office Assistant <span class=date>Aug. 2014  -  Dec. 2016</span></h3>
      <p>
        Communicated with students, faculty, and staff by answering phones and
        directing walk-ins. When the computer science department moved 
        buildings, I assisted faculty and staff by moving and unpacking boxes 
        in the new department building.

      <h2>Internet of Robotic Things</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on bringing a robot onto the Internet of Things (IoT).
        Using an on-board Raspberry Pi, the robot transmits lidar data, battery level,
        and other telemetry to the Pi.  The Pi then uses wifi to transmit 
        that data to an online dashboard called <i>Thingsboard</i>. 
        A full report of the project so far can be 
        downloaded <a href="IoRT.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
 
      <h2>Autonomous Indoor Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        This is my graduate project which focuses on using the lidar to navigate through
        indoor environments. This is to be done using a residual convolutional neural
        network.  The network works upon what the robot sees and where the robot wants 
        to go, much like how humans navigate.  This is done using lidar data and a
        relative target position. Once the network is trained, it will take that data
        and produce translational and rotational velocities which the robot will 
        translate into motor power.
        The neural network is trained using publically available datasets and
        I am working on a way to get more training data by collecting data on the Pi
        from the robot.

      <h2>Kepler Orbital Simulator</h2>
      <p>
        This was my undergraduate project where I developed the back-end for an
	orbital simulator using Keplers Laws of oribital mechanics.  
	This simulator displays relative planetary positions based on any date.
  	This project was motivated by a need for new software in the Appalachian
	State Astronomy Department.  Lab students were using a simulator that was 
	older than I was, and so it was slow, glitchy, and difficult to use.  A
	collegue and I decided to update it to the 21st century.
	<a href="../vids/">Here</a> is a video showing the simulator in action.

      <h2>Orbis</h2>
      <p>
        Orbis was made by my roomate and I in our freshman year as a personal
	project to put our newly found programming skills to the test.
        <a href="">Here</a> is a link to some gameplay.  This is a simple top-down
	shooter where the player is a circle (orb) fighting against waves of
	enemy circles.

	We didn't quite understand github back then, and so google drive seemed 
	to be the most sensible option at the time. <a href="">Here</a> is a drive
	link for the game download (works on Windows and Mac).
